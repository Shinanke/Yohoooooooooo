        <p class="intro">This is my love letter to you.</p>
        
        <div class="love-letter">
            <p>Hana,</p>
            <p>It feels like just yesterday we first met. July 19th... I remember it so clearly. I was just scrolling through and then your profile popped up. Something about it caught my eye, and I decided to say hello. Honestly, I never expected it to turn into anything like this. Seven months. Seven months of chatting, laughing, sometimes staying up way too late just talking about everything and nothing. It's crazy how quickly time has passed.</p>
            <p>You're so different from anyone I've ever met. Your cuteness and your teeth always make me happy, and your smile is so refreshing. Even though we're miles apart..you in Iran, me here in India, it feels like we're in the same room sometimes haha. That's how comfortable I am talking to you.</p>
            <p>I know online relationships can be… complicated. People have opinions, and there's always that distance. But with you, Hana, it just feels… right. I look forward to your messages, I replay our conversations in my head and I genuinely miss you when we haven't talked for a while. You make me laugh, you make me think, and you, Hana, make me feel something I haven't felt in a long time.</p>
            <p>This Valentine's Day, I wanted to do something special for you. Something to show you how much you mean to me. This website, this letter… it's just a small token of what's in my heart. I hope it makes you smile. I hope it makes you feel even a fraction of the happiness you bring to my life.</p>
            <p>I don't know what is the future, but I do know that I cherish every moment we've shared. I'm so grateful that i have you, and I can't wait to see what the next seven months, and beyond, bring.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day, Hani 💘💌.</p>
            <p class="signature">With all my heart,<br>Anya</p>
